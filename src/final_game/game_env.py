'''

Will try a single position game with CFR

We will fix the list of players - so that we limit the scope of possibilities - and then our function we train will be:

f(B_self, B_opp, Mean_self, Mean_opp, Slots_self, Slots_opp, Cur Player Mean) -> distribution over 1 -> 100 of how much to bid

We will use Deep CFR to solve this
